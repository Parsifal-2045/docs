# Welcome to my documentation website!

This is a personal documentation website. There is no pretense of completness or total correctness of the information provided. This website evolves together with my understanding, thus it might contain wrong or partial information about a multitude of topics and especially regarding CMSSW.

## Content
I will try to include all utilities and useful findings developed during my PhD, but remember that this is not meant as an official documentation page. For specific documentation, please refer to the comprehensive [CMSSW documentation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Red_Kitten_01.jpg) :) (but seriously, we now have pages to document specific projects such as [HLT Upgrade](https://cmshltupgrade.docs.cern.ch/) and [CMS-NGT](https://cms-ngt-hlt.docs.cern.ch/)).

However, many topics are covered here, including:

- CMSSW (how-to, recipies, workflows and findings)
- General linux CLI usage
- Glossary with acronyms and words coming from a bunch of different backgrounds
- Any other thing that I find useful or might want to refer back to

That is about all for the introduction. Enjoy your stay here üçÄ.
