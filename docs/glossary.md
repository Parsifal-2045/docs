# Glossary

## A
- **ALU**: *Arithmetic Logic Unit*. Circuit to perform arithmetic and bitwise operations on integers.
- **AOD**: *Analysis Object Data*. This is a "distilled" version of the RECO event information, and was used for most analyses on Run 1 data.
- **API**: *Application Programming Interface*. A type of software interface to offer services to other softwares 

## B
- **BPIX**: *Barrel Pixel Detector*. The innermost layer of the CMS tracking system, designed to provide high-resolution tracking of charged particles.

## C
- **CERN**: *Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (European Organization for Nuclear Research)*. The international organization that operates the LHC and hosts the CMS experiment.
- **CKF**: *Combinatorial Kalman Filter*. Search-tree-based algorithm for track finding and fitting. 
- **CMS**: *Compact Muon Solenoid*. A general-purpose detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) designed to investigate a wide range of physics phenomena.
- **CMSSW**: *CMS Software*. CMS reconstruction software.
- **CRB**: *Collaboration Review Board*. A board that reviews and approves publications and presentations from the CMS Collaboration.
- **CSC**: *Cathode Strip Chamber*. Gaseous detector used in the endcaps of the CMS muon system.

## D
- **DAQ**: *Data Acquisition*. The system responsible for collecting and processing data from the CMS detector.
- **DAS**: *Data Aggregation System*. A system used within CMS to aggregate and provide access to various datasets.
- **DPO**: *Data Preservation Officer*. The person responsible for ensuring that CMS data is properly archived and preserved for future analysis.
- **DQM**: *Data Quality Monitoring*. A system that ensures the data collected by CMS is of high quality and free from errors.
- **DT**: *Drift Tube*. Gaseous detector used in the barrel region of the CMS Muon system.

## E
- **ECAL**: *Electromagnetic Calorimeter*. A component of the CMS detector designed to measure the energy of electrons and photons.
- **EB**: *Executive Board*. A subset of the Institution Board that handles executive functions and day-to-day management of the collaboration.
- **EDM**: *Event Data Model*. Programming paradigm at the base of the CMS software. The *Event* is a C++ container for all RAW and reconstructed data related to a particular collision. When CMS data is processed, information is passed from one module to another via the Event and is only accessed through it. 

## F
- **FEVT**: *Full Event*. In CMSSW, it refers to the content of the output file meaning that all the objects from the event are stored. The actual contents of the file will vary depending on the step (e.g a step2 will save all HLT objects, a step3 all RECO ones).
- **FPIX**: *Forward Pixel Detector*. Part of the CMS tracking system located in the forward regions, complementing the Barrel Pixel Detector.

## G
- **GEM**: *Gas Electron Multiplier*. A type of detector technology used in CMS to detect particles with high precision.

## H
- **HCAL**: *Hadron Calorimeter*. A detector component that measures the energy of hadrons (particles made of quarks, such as protons and neutrons).
- **HEP**: *High Energy Physics*.
- **HLT**: *High-Level Trigger*. A software system that rapidly analyzes data from the detector to decide which events are interesting enough to record for further analysis.
- **HL-LHC**: *High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider*. An upgrade of the LHC aiming to increase its luminosity, allowing for more data collection and higher precision measurements.
- **HS06 / HS23** : *HEP-SPEC 2006 / 2023*. Standard for measuring computing performance in High Energy Physics.

## I
- **IB**: *Institution Board*. The governing body of the CMS Collaboration, responsible for major decisions and policies.

## L
- **LHC**: *Large Hadron Collider*. The world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator, located at CERN.

## M
- **MINIAOD**: Slimmer version of AOD, used for analyses on Run 2 data.
- **MVA**: *Multivariate Analysis*.

## N
- **NANOAOD**: Even slimmer version of MINIAOD, used for Run 3 analyses

## P
- **PAG**: *Physics Analysis Group*. Subgroups within the CMS Collaboration focused on specific areas of physics analysis.
- **PCA**: *Point of Closest Approach*. The point on a track-helix with the smallest distance to the -axis.
- **POG**: *Physics Object Group*. Teams responsible for developing and maintaining the reconstruction and identification algorithms for different types of particles detected by CMS.

## R
- **RPC**: *Resistive Plate Chamber*. A type of particle detector used in the CMS muon system.
- **RAW**: full event information from the CMS experiment, containing "raw" detector information (detector element hits, etc).
- **RECO**: *RECOnstructed data*. The output from first-pass processing by the Tier-0 (Offline reconstruction). This data tier contains reconstructed physics objects, but it's still very detailed.

## S
- **SiPM**: *Silicon Photomultiplier*. A device used to detect light in various parts of the CMS detector.

## T
- **TDR**: *Technical Design Report*. A detailed document outlining the design and specifications of a sub-detector system within the LHC experiments.
